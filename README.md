# Rescue-Major-ROS-Packages
This is a ROS repository for the ROS packages we are using on the robot.

Keep it clean and in a good state, the only thing that should be in the root is
folders that each contain their own ROS package. this can then be cloned into
the src of the catkin workspace and catkin make can then be done to make it
accessible via rosrun, roslaunch, etc.
