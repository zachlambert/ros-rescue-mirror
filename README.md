# Starting the robot

Start the full robot:  
`roslaunch arbie_bringup arbie.launch`

This uses a webserver for teleoperation, which can be viewed at:  
`localhost:8000/arbie_webgui`

The `arbie_test` package contains launch files for running specific subsystems and testing in simulation, eg:  
`roslaunch arbie_test arm.launch` -> Starts arm control only  
`roslaunch arbie_test sim_arm.launch` -> Starts arm control only in simulation

If testing in simulation, the gazebo server must be started for a given world:  
`roslaunch arbie_gazebo manipulation.launch` -> World for testing arm control. (Currently empty, but could add objects to interact with)  
`roslaunch arbie_gazebo navigation.launch` -> World for testing navigation. Has walls and obstacles.

The gazebo client isn't necessary, but can be useful for directly interacting with the simulation. Start with:  
`rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient`

# Overview of packages

## Packages for running the robot

**arbie_bringup**: Contains a launch file for starting the robot with all subsystems.

**arbie_test**: Contains launch files for testing different parts of the system, both for the real robot and simulation.

**arbie_gazebo**: Defines gazebo worlds for simulation, and launch files for starting the gazebo server with these worlds.

## Robot model and control

**arbie_description**
- Defines the robot model with an urdf file. Contains a number of variations of the model used for testing purposes.
- Also contains configuration for ros_control and launch files for spawning controllers for different parts of the robot.

**arbie_hardware**:
- Contains configuration for usb ports of hardware drivers and main pcb.
- Nodes for driving robot joints and a controller manager node to provide an interface for these drivers.
- Contains a launch file for connecting to the hardware drivers and pcb, and starting the hardware interface.
- Not necessary for simulation, where the gazebo server simulates the hardware instead, and also provides a hardware interface.

## Teleoperation

**arbie_webgui**:
- Contains the html/css/javascript for the webgui, in the www subdirectory.
- Provides an interface for monitoring and controlling the robot.

**arbie_teleop**:
- Provides the gamepad node for processing Xbox controller inputs.
- Contains a launch file for starting the webgui, gamepad node, and other required nodes.

## Manipulation

**arbie_moveit_config**:  
- Package generated by moveit_setup_assistant.
- Used to start the move_group node, which provides services for planning and executing trajectories for the robot arm.

**arbie_manipulation**:
- Listens to end effector velocity commands and drives the arm in real time.
- Can also move a planned end effector pose and execute commands for moving to this pose.

## SLAM and navigation

**arbie_slam**:
- Contains a launch file for starting the realsense cameras.
- Contains a launch file for starting rtabmap_ros, which performs slam and can also plan trajectories.

## Dependencies

**arbie_msgs**: Defines custom msg and srv types used by other packages.

The packages below are git submodules:

**realsense_ros_gazebo**: Urdf macros for defining the realsense cameras and gazebo options for simulating the camera inputs.

**robotics_group_upatras_gazebo_plugins**: Contains the mimic_joint gazebo plugin, used to drive the end effector joints appropriately.
